I've been doing rails development for almost 6 years and lately I've
been feeling angry and in discomfort. The personalities around and
opinions make me sick. I keep hearing hipster bullshit. I will lay out
the main things I pursue on a daily basis, and try to explain why I feel
this way.

## Pair programming

This subject is overated and misused. Companies will tell you "we pair a
lot" when they hire you. BULLSHIT!. You will stumble upon a ton of pair
programming blog posts, and still, you won't be able to do it. The most
frustrating part is that developers are stuborn and think they can't
benefit from pair programming. BULLSHIT!

Another reason why pair programming is NOT an option, is that it slows
your team velocity.  This is BULLSHIT! unless you're a short term decision maker. For the
sake of keeping this post short, I won't talk about the good parts of
p.p., you can find a lot if you google it. I doubt you'll find a post
saying why NOT to do it.

## Pull Request Review

If we don't do pair programming it's fine. The only requirement is that
when you submit your pull request you'll receive comments that will make
the feature perform better (in any way), or make YOU better. It drives
me nuts to receive frequent comments like:

- Use $stdMargin instead of 10px.
- Oh, we need the parens to define a method.
- Per our style, we don't have spaces between operators and operands.
- The docstring should say 'it raises error...'

These comments hold their value, but won't make me a better developer.
This frustrates me a lot.

## Technological Diversity

In technology everything change so fast, you don't have time to be
comfortable coding in 1 language. You always need to be learning new
things, otherwise, in ~8 years you might be struggling. I say this not
because I want to convince you to learn more just to keep your job, but
to express that curiosity should be always ON.

If you don't have the curiosity, then don't stop other people from being
curious. This translates directly to the kind of events your company
might sponsor. You might hear some comments like these when pushing back on an
event:

- Our teams aren't intersted.
- We won't use that techonology/lang/framework in this company.
- I'm sorry, we just can't.

In my opinion this is like giving the finger to open source. It's like
biting the hand of the one that gave you food in the first place. Of
course this applies to companies that run on an open source stack.

## Conclusion

I don't know if I'm wrong or my environment is wrong, but I'm starting
to feel out of place and that sucks. I keep my mental sanity by contributing
to open source and so far has been working great. However, sometimes the
breach between open source projects complexity and the complexity at my
current job are way off. I guess there's no other way to keep up to with
that "complexity" than keep practicing and keep contributing.

Please send me a tweet if you have an opinion. Good or bad, it will
help. It terrifies me to think that I will need to deal with this
situation forever.
